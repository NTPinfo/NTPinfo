/**
 * A function to convert the received RIPE measurement JSON to a RIPEData datapoint.
 * All values are extracted directly from the JSON file, with a few exceptions.
 * Time is converted from the NTP Epoch to the UNIX Epoch before being stored.
 * Some fields that do not appear in the JSON are hardcoded to empty or -1
 * offset and RTT are multiplied by 1000 since they are sent in seconds instead of ms.
 * got_results is filled as a boolean to indicate whether the probe sucessfully finished its measurement, as we could receive probes with no measurement values.
 * By our set convention, -1 is the default value in the measurement fields, and it indicates that the measurement was not completed by the probe.
 * The measurement ID is stored here as well as in the trigger for showing it together will all the other results.
 * @param fetchedData the JSON which will be received from the RIPE measurement endpoint.
 * @returns A single RIPEData datapoint filled with information extracted from the JSON, or null if there is no JSON
